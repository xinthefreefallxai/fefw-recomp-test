// ---- compute shadows: storage and texel buffers of a dispatch in device-local memory ---------------------------------------------
// Pools are the game's own memory imported into Vulkan, so a shader reaches storage buffers and texel buffers over PCIe. Compute shaders
// that work on such buffers (the exposure histogram's atomics, the 4 MiB simulation buffers) took 9 ms each on an RTX 3080. [nvn]
// compute_shadows (default on): each storage or texel buffer range a dispatch binds (up to 16 MiB) is bound from device-local memory.
//  * Direct ([nvn] compute_direct, default on): the range is in a pool with a device-local copy (nvn_gpu_pool.cpp, the pool mirror). The
//    dispatch binds the copy itself. Pages the copy does not hold (the CPU wrote them since the GPU last used them) are copied in from the
//    pool first (mirror_fill), so only the CPU's writes cross PCIe. A range the shader may write is written in the copy; it goes back to the
//    pool once, when something other than a compute binding of the same range could look at it: before any command other than a dispatch,
//    a state change or a barrier, before a dispatch reads it another way (uniform block, indirect arguments, another range on its pages,
//    a texture upload), and at the end of the submission, before the serial the CPU waits for can signal. A run of dispatches over the
//    same buffers thus copies each result out once instead of once per dispatch.
//  * Shadow (otherwise: no copy for the pool, hot or banned pages, a range over two chunks): the range is copied into a buffer of its own
//    before the dispatch and copied back after it when the shader can write it (and into the pool copy, when there is one).
